2.2.1.4 Train Radio Block Diagram 
The below block diagram illustrates the distribution of the audio and control information from the Train Radio to the ELA system. The train is installed with a single Train Radio located in WGT1 car and integrated into the On Board 
Unit (OBU) (Not LTG Supply). The OBU utilizes an audio and control bus to forward Train Radio audio and control information between the ELA system via the FBU modules located in the WGT1 and WGT 9 cars. Thus the train 
radio interface directly to the ELA is the FBU modules.

2.3.1 Ethernet Messaging  
The below diagram provides the ELA block diagram for Ethernet messaging. The ELA system will utilize the train network (Not LTG Supply) to implement Train Real time Data Protocol messaging (TRDP) for the distribution of audio 
through Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Status and control messaging between modules will also be sent over TRDP. The central point of communication between the ELA and the Train Control Management System (TCMS) will be 
the CCU+ in the active cab (Master CCU+). If no cab is active then the master CCU+ will default to the WGT 9 car.

4.2.1.5 Half Duplex communication between Driver and OCC (OCC-TR). 
The ELA system provides functionality for Half-Duplex communication between the Operational Control 
Centre (OCC) and the Driver. By default the ELA system is in Train Radio mode. With no other mode 
selected pressing the Cab desk PTT button will route audio from the Gooseneck Microphone (GM) 
directly to the Train Radio interface, through the FEU. Any audio received from the train radio is played 
over the Train Radio Loudspeaker. 
The driver can switch to using the Driver Handset (HS) at any time through lifting the HS from the 
console. When this occurs incoming audio is switched from the TRSPK to the HS Earpiece and the 
Gooseneck Microphone (GM) input to the CCU+ closes as the HS microphone input opens. Talk privilege 
is gained by the driver through pressing the HS PTT button. This is reversable through placing the 
handset back onto the cradle.

4.2.1.6 Half Duplex Communication between Drivers (IC). 
The ELA system provides Half Duplex communication between cabs (IC). The system is to handle IC call initiation with the following logic: 
• IC call initiated from active cab will be sent to all non-active cabs. 
• IC call initiated from a non-active cab will only be sent to the active cab 
Both Non-active and active cabs can initiate an IC call through rotating the ‘Station’ rotary switch to the ‘Speak’ position. Once initiated the non-initiating cab will play an alert message through the CSPK. The non-initiating cab may accept 
the call through rotating the ‘Station’ rotary switch to the ‘Speak’ position. At which point the alert tone played through the CSPK is stopped 
While the non-initiating cab holds the ‘station’ rotary switch in the ‘speak’ position, the non-initiating cab has talk privilege and audio is routed from the non-initiating cab GM to the initiating cab CSPK. When the non-initiating cab releases 
the  ‘station’ rotary switch to the ‘0’ position, talk privilege is passed to the initiating cab and audio is routed from the initiating cab GM to the non-initiating cab CSPK. 
Operators in the non-initiating cabs control talk back privilege through rotating the ‘Station’ rotary switch to the ‘Speak’ position. While rotated and held in this position the non-initiating cab has talk back privilege, with audio routed from the 
non-active cab GM to the active cab CSPK. When the non-initiating cab ‘Station’ rotary switch is released to the ‘0’ position. Talk back privilege is returned back to the initialing cab.  
Either cab can terminate the IC call  through turning the ‘Station’ rotary switch to the ‘Clear’ position. 
The IC call enters ‘Parked’ mode if an ELA function with higher priority is activated. When the IC call is parked the Intercom indicator will flash. Once the higher priority function is ended the, IC function will exit parked mode, indicated by 
the intercom indicators (Non LTG supplied) turning on in both cabs.

4.2.1.7 Half Duplex communication between Driver and PCU(PCU). 
The PCU alarms are arranged in the following order within the 5 car MZ and 9 car XLZ 
 
Figure 27 PCU/DPCU locations 
The ELA system provides Half-Duplex communication between PCU alarm stations and the Driver. The PCU modules provide 2 specific modes of operation.  
4.2.1.7.1 Passenger Call Request 
A Passenger call Request can be made through both PCU and alarms for people with reduced Mobility DPCU. The request is made through pressing the PCU button. On activation the PCU alarm notifies the master CCU+ of its activation 
via TRDP and SIP, The CCU+ in turn notifies the TCMS of the PCU activation and location via TRDP. 
After activation the PCU ‘Wait’ LED will illuminates for 0.5 seconds. After 0.5 seconds the PCU ‘Wait’ LED will then start to flash. By default the system will play no alarm tone through the active cab CSPK. The system supports a 
configurable item which when active causes an audible alarm to play in the active cab on PCU talk request activation. The alarm tone will be stored in the CCU+. 
The driver can accept the PCU call and enter Driver to Passenger Talkback mode through moving the ‘Station’ rotary switch to the ‘speak’ position. At this point the PCU Wait LED will turn on and any audible alarm will be cancelled. 
When the ‘Station’ rotary switch is released back to the ‘0’ position by the driver, the ELA system enters PCU Driver Listen mode. On the PCU the ‘Wait/Listen’ LED turns off and the ‘Speak’ LED illuminates. Audio received by the PCU 
microphone is then transferred to the active cab CSPK. 
The driver can regain talk priority through turning and holding the ‘Station’ rotary switch in the ‘Speak’ position. While the rotary switch is held in this position the ELA enters PCU-Driver Speak Mode.  
The Driver can cancel the PCU talk request by turning the ‘’Station’ Rotary switch to the ‘Clear’ position. This can only be done after the driver has first accepted the PCU call. Once this is done the talk request is effectively cancelled. 
Audio is no longer distributed between the PCU and cab, and the PCU status LED returns to having the ‘Ready’ LED illuminated. 
In the event of multiple PCU Passenger Call request activations the active PCU’s become parked and enter a queue of first in first out order. Once the first PCU in the queue has been addressed and the call cleared by the driver the next 
PCU in the que becomes active, starting in the PCU talk request wait mode. While parked the PCU ‘Wait’ LED flashes. In the event of an Emergency Call function the active PCU will become parked and is placed into the first position in 
the que if a PCU alarm que is present. 
The below Figure 27 details a Flow diagram of the Passenger Call Request. It highlights 4 specific modes: 
• PCU Talk Request Wait 
o Mode activated on the initiation of the Passenger Call Request. 
o On the PCU the ‘Wait’ LED illuminates for 0.5 seconds, after which the LED will start to flash. 
o In the active cab the Intercom request indicator will flash (Alstom Control) 
o Alarm tone plays through the CSPK if configurable parameter is set.  
• PCU Talk Request Driver Listen 
o When the ‘Station’ rotary switch is moved to the ‘0’ position the Passenger talk request enters PCU Talk Request Driver Listen mode. 
o The PCU ‘Wait’ LED turns off and the PCU ‘Speak’ LED turns on. 
o Audio is now transmitted from the PCU microphone to the active Cab Loudspeaker. 
• PCU Talk Request Driver Speak 
o When the ‘Station’ rotary switch is held in the ‘Speak’ position the Passenger talk request enters PCU Talk Request Driver Speak mode. 
o The PCU ‘Speak’ LED turns off and the PCU ‘Wait’ LED turns on. 
o Audio is now transmitted from the Gooseneck Microphone to the active PCU speaker. 
• PCU Talk Request Parked  
o The PCU Talk Request Parked mode occurs when either: 
▪ A higher priority audio request is received 
▪ An Emergency PCU call is received. 
▪ Multiple PCU alarms active. 
o The PCU ‘Wait’ LED starts to flash. 
o On completion of the higher priority audio function or PCU Emergency call the PCU Talk request enters PCU talk request wait mode, where the driver will need to accept the call to continue.

Figure 28 Passenger Call Request Flow Diagram 
4.2.1.7.2 Passenger Emergency Call 
Passenger Emergency Calls are activated through 2 means: 
• PCU external emergency signal (PCU X1 Pins 2 (+24V) and 3(0V)).  
o If activated via the PCU external emergency signal the PCU alarm notifies the master CCU+ of its activation via TRDP, The CCU+ in turn notifies the TCMS of the PCU activation and location via TRDP. The TCMS is also 
notified of the PCU Emergency call activation through an auxiliary output (X3 Pins 1 (+24V) and 2 (0V)) on the PCU module. 
• TCMS to master CCU+ request via TRDP, through activation of the Emergency Door Release signal. 
o On TCMS activation request the CCU+ will activate the  doors associated PCU device. Once activated the CCU+ will inform the TCMS of the PCU activation. 
PCU’s located in areas for people with reduced mobility (DPCU) do not have this function (PCUs 11, 12, 5 and 6). On activation the PCU ‘Wait’ LED illuminates briefly before the ‘Speak’ LED illuminates. The ELA system enters ‘PCU-
EMER Driver listen mode’. The audio signal from the PCU microphone is then routed to the active cab CSPK without further input from the driver. 
On activation audio from the PCU microphone will be played through the CSPK. Similar to the Passenger Call request the system features a configurable parameter that when set activates an audible tone to be played through the Active 
cab loud speaker on PCU Emergency call activation. By default this parameter will be set to off so as no tone is played. The alarm audio tone will be merged with audio received from the active PCU.

The driver can control the speak privilege through turning the ‘Station’ rotary switch to the ‘Speak’ position, when operated the ELA system enters ‘PCU-EMER Driver speak mode’. When rotated to this position audio from the GM is 
played through the active PCU loudspeaker, the PCU microphone is turned off, the PCU ‘Wait’ LED illuminates and the PCU ‘Speak’ LED is turned off. If the parameter for an audio alarm tone is set to play an alarm tone then the alarm 
tone will be canceled on the first occurrence of the driver moving the ‘Speak’ rotary switch to the ‘Speak’ position. 
In the event of alarm activation from PCU external emergency signal, the alarm may only be cancelled through resetting of the emergency activation input to the PCU. This task is to be performed by the train crew. If the alarm is activated 
via TCMS request the PCU alarm will remain active until the TCMS activation request is removed 
In the event of multiple PCU Emergency call activation the active PCU’s become queued in a first in first out order. Once the first PCU in the queue has been addressed and the call cleared by the train crew resetting the active PCU, the 
next PCU in the stack becomes active. PCU’s waiting in the stack have their respective ‘Wait’ LED’s illuminated.  
The below Figure 28 details a flow diagram of PCU Emergency call operation which identifies 3 modes 
1. PCU Emergency Driver Listen Mode 
o First mode following activation of a PCU Emergency call, mode also accessed through driver releasing ‘Speak’ rotary switch to the ‘0’ position. 
o PCU ‘Wait’ LED illuminates briefly before turning off and the PCU ‘Speak’ LED illuminates. 
o Audio from the PCU microphone is routed to the active cab Cab Loudspeaker. 
o If parameter is set audible tone is merged with PCU audio and played through active cab CLS. 
1. PCU Emergency Driver Speak Mode 
o Mode activated through driver rotating the ‘Speak’ rotary switch to the ‘0’ position. 
o PCU ‘Speak’ LED turns off. PCU ‘Wait’ LED turns on 
o Audio is routed from the Gooseneck Microphone to the active PCU speaker. 
o In the first instance of this mode being entered if the configurable PCU Emergency alarm tone is active it will be silenced. 
1. PCU Emergency Parked Mode 
o Mode entered only for PCU call that are queued (Not detailed in flow diagram) 
o PCU ‘Wait’ LED flashes

4.2.1.8 Automated Announcements (AA) 
The ELA system provides audio distribution of automated announcements received from the On-
Board Unit (OBU) located in WGT1. Automatic Announcement audio signals are received in analogue 
format from the OBU through FEU Connector X6 pins 5 and 18. The OBU interfaces the below inputs 
to the Front End Unit (FEU) X6 connector in WGT1, with regard to where the automated 
announcements are to be played.

4.2.1.9 Departure Tone 
The ELA supports playback of 2 different departure tones over the External loudspeakers. Selection 
of tone to be played as well as start and stop of the tone will be completed through TCMS TRDP 
communication to the master CCU+. The following departure tones will be supplied by Alstom. 
1. Continuous 330Hz departure tone. 
2. Alternating 1900HZ 60 ms on/ 60 ms off 
The departure tones will be stored as .wav file type on both CCU+. The system will allow the tones to 
be changed through upload of a new tone through the MST tool. 
4.2.2 Train Radio Panic Mode 
The ELA system features a Panic Mode. Panic Mode is entered through the receipt of TCMS request 
to the CCU+. Once Panic Mode is entered the Gooseneck Microphone (GM) input to the CCU+ opens 
and all audio received from the GM by the CCU+ is sent to the train radio. 
4.2.3 Fallback Mode 
In the event of failure to the train network or Software failure of the CCU+ the ELA system will enter 
Fallback mode. While in fallback mode the following audio functions remain available: 
• OCC-TR 
• OCC-PA 
• PA-INT/EXT 
While in fallback mode the ELA will utilize the UIC train lines for audio signal control and distribution. 
The UIC train lines consist of 3 pairs, with further details of their use provided in the below table. 
Table 35 UIC Train Lines 
UIC Pair Description 
PA AF PA Analogue audio signal 
PA EN PA Enable signal (+24v)

In the event that the failure causing fallback mode clears during operation the system will revert back 
to normal operation. 
4.2.4 Tow mode  
The ELA System supports the coupling of 2 Tram sets for Towing/Pushing operation. The ELA 
system is designed to support this formation on the premise that a coupling Tram set may utilize an 
older audio system with requiring output/input of a 100Vpp audio signal. 
Electrical coupling between the 2 vehicles is made through the use of a ‘Suppression Cable’. The 
suppression cable consists of 2 pairs, 1 control pair and 1 audio signal pair. The suppression cable 
input to the ELA system is through the FEU X2 connector and denoted as Legacy Trainlines. 
Through the use of the Suppression cable the ELA system allows for 2 intervehicle functions. These 
functions and corresponding control characteristics are detailed below in Table 33 
Table 36 Tow Mode Function 
Control Line Signal 
Function 
Control Inside Control Outside 
PA Interior (PA-INT) +24V 0V 
PA Interior/Exterior (PA-INT/EXT) 0V +24V 
 
Control of these functions from the modified unit is the same as within normal mode (Rotation of the 
‘Speaker’ rotary switch to either the internal or external position).  
When the modified unit receives audio input via the suppression cable, the audio function requested 
is played respective to its position in the Audio priority tables detailed in 4.2.8 Audio Priorities. Such 
that if a higher priority function is in progress or appears during input stream, the audio input will not 
be played. 
4.2.5 Multiple Unit Operation (Coupled) 
The ELA system supports the operation of 2 MZ 5 Car units coupled. When operated in this mode the 
ethernet and UIC train lines of both vehicle are connected.  
While in Multiple unit operation all functionality is available as previously described in Normal Mode. 
4.2.6 Special Announcements 
The ELA system provides a Special announcement feature. Upon door release the CCU+ will stream 
a announcement for playback over all EXT-SPK-V4 speakers. 
The announcement to be played is stored on the CCU+ with the following characteristics: 
• File Type: .wav 
• Maximum size is 10Mb 
The audio file will be played over the EXT-SPK-V4 speakers upon master CCU+ receipt of Door 
Released signal from the TCMS. 
The audio file shall be configurable, allowing the end user to change the audio file through the MST.

4.2.9 TCMS Communication for the reporting of ELA error and status information. 
The master CCU+ Master will report the following status information to the TCMS via TRDP: 
• Passenger Call Request Activation 
• PCU Communication mode status 
• PCU failure event 
o Loss of communication 
o Configuration file error 
• ACC failure event 
o Loss of communication 
o Configuration file error 
• CCU+ failure event  
o Loss of communication 
o Configuration file error 
In the event of failure of the master CCU+ the remaining CCU+ will take over as the Master CCU+ . If 
the failure is cleared the process will reverse with the original CCU+ resuming as Master. 
4.2.10 Ambient noise dependent automatic volume adjustment. 
The ELA system features automatic ambient noise volume adjustment in the saloon areas. Each PCU 
microphone samples the ambient Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in the saloon area. This measurement 
is communicated to the Master CCU+ via Ethernet communication. The CCU+ will calculate the 
required change to SPL and communicate this to the ACC.  The ACC can then adjust the playback 
volume of any announcements in the saloon by at least +6dB to a basic 75dB 
If a failure occurs preventing automatic volume adjustment, such as Ethernet connectivity or Software 
failure of the ACC. The volume level defaults to a fixed hardware dependent value. 
4.2.11 Adjustable System Variables 
The ELA system allows for the adjustment of several system variables through Web Browser 
connection to the CCU+. These parameter include: 
• Volume adjustment of the minimum volume for the Cab Loudspeaker  
• PCU activation Cab Speaker Alert tone parameter On/Off 
• Gooseneck Microphone input level for the following modes: 
o PCU Talk 
o PA
