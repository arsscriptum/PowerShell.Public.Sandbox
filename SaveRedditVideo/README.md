# Save Reddit Video

A simple function to save Reddit videos you wish to keep. Pass the URL of the Reddit Post and the optional destination location.

### Dependencies

You need [html-agility-pack](https://html-agility-pack.net/) installed and loaded... I put them in the ```lib``` folder for your convenience...

You also need **NativeProgressModule** which is included...
